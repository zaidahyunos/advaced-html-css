        It takes more than one quick class and four or five dives to learn to be
        a competent, independent diver as well as a useful and capable partner
        for another diver. This is why we do not only focus on your initial
        certification course, but also accompany you much further along the
        path, indicating the route you need to take and providing you with the
        background knowledge you need to make the right choices.
